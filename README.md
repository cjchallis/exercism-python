# Exercism in Python

This contains my solutions to the [exercism](http://exercism.io) exercises in Python. Although exercism already uses GitHub under the hood, I wanted an explicit repository in order to sync exercises to my iPhone with [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) for Python interpretation and [shellista](https://github.com/transistor1/shellista) for `git` functionality.

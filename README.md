# Exercism in Python

This contains my solutions to the [exercism](http://exercism.io) exercises in Python. Although exercism already uses GitHub under the hood, I wanted an explicit repository in order to sync exercises to my iPhone. On the phone I use [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) for Python interpretation and [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) for `git` functionality.
